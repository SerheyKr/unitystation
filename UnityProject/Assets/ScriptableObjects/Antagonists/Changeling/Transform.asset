  description: A starter ability. The changeling can transform into any of the DNAs
    they have stored, allowing them to become nearly anyone. It will also mimic their
    clothing and ID, if you're not already wearing one in those slots. These fake
    items will be non-functional but can be deleted by clicking them or by using
    the Drop Flesh Disguise option from the transformation menu. Transforming also
    gives you a temporary but fully functional copy of the transform target's Skillchips.
